This week we learnt about binary and how it counts in ones and zeros. It was very interesting how a computer can count to such big numbers in such a confusing way. Then we learnt how PSY with his hit song Gangnam Style broke YouTube. He did it by getting so many views. YouTube only had a 32 but counter for the views half did positive half did negative but after 2.3 million views or so it couldn't go up any more because there weren't enough bits to count that high so went to negative numbers and count up from negative 2.3 million.
