Today we learned about loops and lists. First we did loops and what a for and while loop were used for and then we went on to some worksheets. First we had to solve a loop problem to see what was wrong and then add to the code. The second worksheet was finding out if the code would run or not and then if it used a while or for loop. Then we learned about lists and did a worksheet on lists and added to code to make a list of superheroes.
