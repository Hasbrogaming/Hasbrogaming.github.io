The first thing we did today was do a buzzfeed quiz. This was to show how multiple answers to questions lead up to one big answer. Then we learned of the ways you could do this in repl. One was adding a total and based on that would give you a final answer, another was start on a number and depending on how low or high it got gave you your answer. There were many other ways as well like a decision tree. This is where the computer finds the highest possible success rate from a range of options and chooses the one that would give the highest success rate. Then when the player goes the computer would go through the decisions again and change its path to get to the highest success rate. This would repeat so the computer is not random and it may seem like the computer is cheating but it isn't it will just have a much higher chance of winning then you. After this our teacher gave us an example by p,along backgammon the computer always gets the role it needs and gets the best role because it is programed to get a high( success rate and so gets better dice roles to help it. Then we started to make our own buzzfeed quiz and tried to figure out the maths for our own quizzes.
