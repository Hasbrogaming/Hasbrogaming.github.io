In today's lesson we learnt about binary and hexadecimal. We learnt about how we count normally which is in base 10. We count in 10's, 100’s and 1000’s but in binary we count in 1’s and 0’s in base 2. This is because it is easy for computers to use.

Bit

Nibble                                                      Bite

Binary is split into three as seen above. One number is a bit, 4 is a nibble and 8 is a bite. Counting in binary then becomes simple if you make a table like the the one above and then put in the number given to you it is then a matter of adding so if the number has a 1 in the far left then it is odd and otherwise it is even. So whichever column there is a 1 in is one where you need to add the number at the top to the total.

Hexadecimal is very similar to binary but in base 16. One of the biggest differences is that   hexadecimal counts from 1 to 9 then keeps going from A to F. The letters keep the numbers       going so A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15. If the number is 5A then you would do                                   5x16+10x1 this is because the 5 is in the 16 column and the 10 is in the 1 column so it would end up as 90 because 5x16=80 and 80+10=90. WE also have to be able to convert between hexadecimal and binary but this is simple as it follows a pattern so if the number or letter on the left was a 5 then you would first get the the number 16x1,2,4,8 this added up equals 15 which is the highest number so you make the number you need out of them and then do the same with the number on the right.
