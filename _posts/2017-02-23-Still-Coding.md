    <td>I used the hint to give me an idea of what to do if I got confused. It helped a lot because I often get stuck on why it isn't working and the hint usually tells me what to do and what I did wrong.</td>

    <td>Nothing I sat down and did my work and tried to get through as much as possible and catch up with my friend who is 5% in front of me.</td>

    <td>I will try and not use the hint as much and try and get the answer just from the instructions.</td>
