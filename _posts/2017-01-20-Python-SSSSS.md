    <td>I used the instructions to help me and if I got stuck looked at what had gone wrong and check the example so I would know where I was going wrong. If I still couldn't do it and had no idea I would check the clue to see if that would help me and most of the time it did and I didnâ€™t have to ask my friends or the teacher.

    <td>I helped my friend Luke a lot because most of the time he had no idea what he had done wrong or what to do so I helped him out and gave him some clues to figure it out and left him to do it himself. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will not help my friend as much and focus on my own work and learn how to code in Python. I will try not to use the clue as much to challenge me and figure it out just using the example and instructions.</td>
