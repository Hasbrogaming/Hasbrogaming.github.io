Today in IT we did discounts as we know how to make a sheet work to end with a normal price but not with discounts. First we had to figure out the sum so if the discount was 20% and the price was Â£25 then the sum would be 25x0.8. Now we only had to make the code. So we used the >= sign so if they had bought enough items they would have been able to use the discount then we used the sum above to get a total with a discount applied to it.
