Today we had a new teacher for our lesson. This was a one off lesson and in the lesson we learnt about compressions. There were two main ones we looked at lossy and lossless compressions. The teacher first made us make a picture from the cells on google sheets. After that we compressed it so if there were 10 black cells on the top we would write 10Bl. But if there were no patterns then the compression would have made it bigger. After we had done this we swapped with people and tried to make there image from the compression.
