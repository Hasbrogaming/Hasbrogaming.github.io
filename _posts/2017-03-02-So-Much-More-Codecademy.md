  <tr>
    <td>I did not get help from anyone today and rarely used the hint which was a lot more effective at making me think more and figure it out with what I was given. I used what was already in  code and the example most of the time to help me instead of the hint.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Helping others because one of my friends is very far behind I helped him a bit today showing him what he was doing wrong however this stopped me from doing my own work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will only help my friend if he is really really stuck and needs help and keep trying not to use the hint.</td>
