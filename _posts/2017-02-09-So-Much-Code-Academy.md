    <td>I used the instructions and when I got stuck I got help from Ethan who was stuck on the same one and we worked it out together. I sat by myself because the computer next to me was unavailable which helped because I didn't help my friend at all.</td>

    <td>I will not help as many people and say no I have to do my own work. I will look at the example pictures more and keep working with Ethan if I get stuck.</td>
