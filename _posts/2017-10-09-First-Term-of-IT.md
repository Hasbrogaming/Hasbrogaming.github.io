First Term of It

In the first term so far we have been looking at google sheets and been using code to be able to send coded messages and receive them easier. I have achieved this by listening to our teacher and then using what i've learnt to make my code better and understand how what i am doing and what the code means. We have learnt lots of commands like len which means length and concatenate which gets letters from different cells and puts them into one. We have done this to get a better understanding of code and what it means and also where people use it and why. This has given us an opportunity to see what coding is actually used for and why people use to make their lives easier.
