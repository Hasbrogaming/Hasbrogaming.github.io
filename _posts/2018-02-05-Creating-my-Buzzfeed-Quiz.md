Today we started to make our buzzfeed quizzes. With my quiz I went for a simple but long code. I used one variable to store a number which was changed with each answer. At the end the number then decides what answer you get. So if you get a very high number then you would get a different answer to what you would get if you got a low number. This code is quite simple but works you can see it here: <iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@harrylonghurst/My-Buzzfeed-Quiz?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
