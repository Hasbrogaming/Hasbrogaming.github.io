Today we learned about using a real life situation into sheets. We did this by making ourselves a spreadsheet used at a till of a shop. We had a few items and there price. We made the so it had a safeguard against spelling mistakes and putting in the wrong number and then made a column where we added up the price and one where the product they were buying and the price showed up. All of this ended up making a completely accident free sheet for a till.
