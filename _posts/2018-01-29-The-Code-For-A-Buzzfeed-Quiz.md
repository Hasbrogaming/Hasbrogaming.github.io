Today our teacher showed us two different ways of doing the code for our buzzfeed quizzes. One way was to make a function and then write out a lot of code for each different question. This method was quite simple but very tedious.

The other method he used was quite complex but took a shorter time. In this he used a for loop and indexes this meant he could ask a question and get an answer back in only a few lines of code. This was very confusing but after a few minutes I started to understand what was going on. He made a list and then had a for loop running and printing what was in the list separately using an index. This will help us in writing our A.I. bot code we are making. The code for my A.I. code is here:
